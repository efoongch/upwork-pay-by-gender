This also includes several other things such as maintaining central dashboard, sending automated email when project is published on the site, etc. \nAnother example is an Automated Recruiting System - in that firstly applicants fills a form if they score more than threshold score then their data is sent to recruiter and they are sent a thank you email and so on.\nSo If you have any job related to Google App Scripts/Google Spreadsheet/Google Forms then I can help you for sure.\n\nI also design custom Google form with image upload fields.\n\nMy skills are:- \n\n* Google App Script for Google Custom Web App , Google Drive , Google Form , Google Spreadsheet , etc\n* For backend PHP & MySQL\n* Responsiveness with Bootstrap\n* Styling using css , javascript\n* Dynamic Animation using jQuery\n* Formstack , Google Forms for the forms to take survey , feedback , Quote Request , Reservation Request , etc .

It was an international team with members from Turkey, Canada and Singapore (us).

The entire program is managed by one, non-tech savvy manager at the cruise line's main office. Reservation agents are located remotely, some as much as 5 time zones away.  \n\nI recently completed a MS Access application that assisted the budget analysts of a public utilities board in budget reporting requirements for projects of $100 Million combined per annum. The application creates reports and tracking mechanisms to meet rigorous reporting requirements that are mandated by the governing board of the utility.\nEach quarter, a new set of budgeting tools are required to be created and communicated to all program directors and managers.

For example: Pascal, Go and Erlang.\n\nSoftware Design wise my main focus has been on MVC and HMVC and I've found little reason to venture to far from these. I also used programming paradigms such as procedural, functional and object orientated and my aim - subject to the languages support - is always for the latter.\n\nWhen it comes to interface design I aim to do as much in code as possible, however I do have experience in Photoshop and I'm more than able to create anything that is needed for a website or application's user interface.

I'm a native English speaker, originally from London and currently living in Girona, Spain (CET).\n\n\nWHY SHOULD YOU HIRE ME?\n\nLet's be honest .. you've probably seen my bid and thought, \"Wow, that's a little higher than some of the others, what makes this fellow worth it?\"\n\nWell .. hire me and you'll see why.  For a start, all of my clients receive my private contact details and can reach me directly, and often instantly whenever they need me.  No middle men, agency or answering services, you get to talk directly to the person working on your code.  I offer a flexibility towards my clients needs that is hard to find in this industry and will happily adapt my working hours to suit your needs, whether you need just a few hours every now and then, or a huge dedicated burst to meet a deadline, you'll find you can count on me to deliver.\n\nNot only do I pride myself on producing clean, robust test-driven and fully linted code, but because it's second nature to me I can also do this fast and efficiently.  I'm confident that you'll not only receive outstanding results, but as my many repeat clients will agree, you'll end up getting far more value than my cheaper competitors.\n\nI'm also very picky about the projects I choose to bid on, only pursuing ones that I feel will be truly engaging over the long term.  By doing this you'll find that I throw myself into my work like nobody else.  You'll find that you'll get not just a developer, but an individual who's genuinely passionate about what he does and someone you can rely on to handle every technical aspect of your project from start to finish and beyond if needed.\n\n\nEXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATIONS\n\nI am widely experienced in several areas of software development having undertaken a large range of jobs over the years from traditional desktop applications to modern cloud and mobile based technologies. My speciality areas include:\n\n- Back end web and application development with Python / Django / Flask.\n- Front end web and single page development with Javascript and Typescript (inc JQuery, Angular, Bootstrap).\n- Web development and administration with PHP (inc Yii & Symfony).\n- Mobile application development with Java, C, Python and / or Javascript with Cordova / PhoneGap / Appcelerator\n- Cross platform desktop application development including Windows, Mac, Linux and Android using C++, Java and more recently Javascript with Atom / Electron.\n- Unity 3D / C# / Unreal engine game development.\n\nOther key skills include the following:\n\n- Test driven development as standard\n- Code profiling and optimization (particularly for high traffic sites)\n- Docker & Vagrant\n- Amazon Web Services\n- Bootstrap\n- SQL, Database design deployment and scaling (including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and NoSQL solutions such as Apache Cassandra)\n- Multimedia Processing & Delivery (inc working with Flash Media Server, Wowza and WMS, as well as developing custom media processing and playback solutions in C++, Flash & Silverlight)\n\nI am a strong supporter of open source technologies and use Linux as my primary work platform. In addition to Linux, I also have significant development experience on Windows and many Windows specific toolchains such as Visual Studio as well as moderate experience with both desktop and mobile application development on OSX.\n\nI am happy to consider projects of all shapes and sizes, and pride myself on offering a fast, friendly and reliable service, and am always happy to push the extra mile for you.

Then, on every next iteration, we design, code, test and add to the software more features and modules. The result of this process is that every cycle produces a software, which is complete in itself and has more features and capabilities than the previous one. This way we always know if we are on the right track and can early learn about the problems without losing time and making costly mistakes. \n\nI don\u2019t see myself as a \u201ccode ninja\u201d or a \"rock star\" or a somebody who \u201ckick ass\u201d. Things like \u201cJavaScript guru\u201d, \u201cPHP guy\u201d, \u201cJava guy\u201d or an \u201cAgile guy\u201d simply doesn\u2019t work for me. Even though I know all these things I have never felt like I fit into any (actually didn\u2019t want to). Where do I fit then? Well, I think it\u2019s beside you, thinking hard to get YOUR project done and make YOUR life better. Once we are done, name it however you like.\n\nIf I would have to declare myself in some way, then I would say that I am expert troubleshooter and tenacious problem solver. I NEVER give up. So, once your dream starts becoming a nightmare I may likely find a way to get you out and bring all sweet dreams again.  \n\nI am well organized as well as my code is. I always use project management tools (Freedcamp, Atlassian JIRA) to put the whole process under control. I follow coding patterns even in small projects, use code revision control repositories, preferably Git (Bitbucket, GitHub, etc.) but Subversion (SVN) as well, and use tools to automatically build and deploy apps (Gradle, Grunt, Gulp, Maven, Ant). When not sure, love to quickly create a proof of concept (POC) just to check where we stand.\n\nMy approach is simple... \n\n1.) Continual research.  \n\n2.) Come up with creative ideas to add value to your cause.\n\n3.) Continual work on identifying potential problems to prevent future obstacles.\n\n4.) Do all my work by myself and NEVER hire anybody else to do it for me.\n\nWant to know even more about practical aspects of my work? What do I love right now? Well, the list is not short. My clients and I love Java, J2EE, JSP, Spring, JPA, Hibernate, Struts, Atlassian JIRA and Confluence addon (plugin) development (server & ondemand), Groovy, Scala, REST, PHP, WordPress, Google Maps API, Twilio API, Zendesk API, PhoneGap Apache Cordova, Android native apps, Hybrid mobile apps, Bootstrap, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, Backbone, Underscore, Node, NodeJS, Bower, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Apache, Tomcat, JBoss and a lot more!\n\nSounds good? Let's schedule a meeting and talk more! To do so, message me or/and\n \nINVITE ME TO YOUR JOB!!! \n\nI don't respond to every client that gets in touch with me but if we seem to be a good fit then I'll definitely hit you back. \n\nLooking forward to meeting you :)\n", "name": "Predrag V.", "last_activity": "October 14, 2017", "rate": "54.0", "member_since": "April 7, 2016", "portfolio_items_count": "14", "id": "~01e6ab37695eb58032", "test_passed_count": "4", "feedback": "4.8866782604"}, {"portrait_50": "https://odesk-prod-portraits.s3.amazonaws.com/Users:dreamdeveloper:PortraitUrl_50?AWSAccessKeyId=1XVAX3FNQZAFC9GJCFR2&Expires=2147483647&Signature=wDn1zmdM3h3shZb6hWIaLUrFeNc%3D&1455992760172985", "categories2": ["Data Science & Analytics", "Sales & Marketing", "Web, Mobile & Software Dev"], "profile_type": "Agency", "title": "Algorithms/Artificial Intelligence/NLP/Machine Learning", "skills": ["artificial-intelligence", "natural-language-processing", "machine-learning", "amazon-web-services", "python", "java", "business-intelligence", "data-science", "system-deployment", "web-scraping"], "country": "India", "description": "MY GUARANTEE  !!! \r\n\r\nPay Upon Approval: Remove risk by paying upon completion of work.

I've been developing software commercially since 1998, and a hobby programmer since my childhood.  Previous clients and work experience include DHL, Securicor Omega Express, Capscan, Monsternett AS, The Restaurant Zone LLC, Sunfly, Dooster, Claims4Free and more.  I'm a native English speaker, originally from London and currently living in Girona, Spain (CET).\n\n\nWHY SHOULD YOU HIRE ME?\n\nLet's be honest .. you've probably seen my bid and thought, \"Wow, that's a little higher than some of the others, what makes this fellow worth it?\"\n\nWell .. hire me and you'll see why.  For a start, all of my clients receive my private contact details and can reach me directly, and often instantly whenever they need me.  No middle men, agency or answering services, you get to talk directly to the person working on your code.  I offer a flexibility towards my clients needs that is hard to find in this industry and will happily adapt my working hours to suit your needs, whether you need just a few hours every now and then, or a huge dedicated burst to meet a deadline, you'll find you can count on me to deliver.\n\nNot only do I pride myself on producing clean, robust test-driven and fully linted code, but because it's second nature to me I can also do this fast and efficiently.  I'm confident that you'll not only receive outstanding results, but as my many repeat clients will agree, you'll end up getting far more value than my cheaper competitors.\n\nI'm also very picky about the projects I choose to bid on, only pursuing ones that I feel will be truly engaging over the long term.  By doing this you'll find that I throw myself into my work like nobody else.  You'll find that you'll get not just a developer, but an individual who's genuinely passionate about what he does and someone you can rely on to handle every technical aspect of your project from start to finish and beyond if needed.\n\n\nEXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATIONS\n\nI am widely experienced in several areas of software development having undertaken a large range of jobs over the years from traditional desktop applications to modern cloud and mobile based technologies. My speciality areas include:\n\n- Back end web and application development with Python / Django / Flask.\n- Front end web and single page development with Javascript and Typescript (inc JQuery, Angular, Bootstrap).\n- Web development and administration with PHP (inc Yii & Symfony).\n- Mobile application development with Java, C, Python and / or Javascript with Cordova / PhoneGap / Appcelerator\n- Cross platform desktop application development including Windows, Mac, Linux and Android using C++, Java and more recently Javascript with Atom / Electron.\n- Unity 3D / C# / Unreal engine game development.\n\nOther key skills include the following:\n\n- Test driven development as standard\n- Code profiling and optimization (particularly for high traffic sites)\n- Docker & Vagrant\n- Amazon Web Services\n- Bootstrap\n- SQL, Database design deployment and scaling (including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and NoSQL solutions such as Apache Cassandra)\n- Multimedia Processing & Delivery (inc working with Flash Media Server, Wowza and WMS, as well as developing custom media processing and playback solutions in C++, Flash & Silverlight)\n\nI am a strong supporter of open source technologies and use Linux as my primary work platform. In addition to Linux, I also have significant development experience on Windows and many Windows specific toolchains such as Visual Studio as well as moderate experience with both desktop and mobile application development on OSX.\n\nI am happy to consider projects of all shapes and sizes, and pride myself on offering a fast, friendly and reliable service, and am always happy to push the extra mile for you.

I\u2019ve been dealing with software development for more then 8 years and I\u2019ve created solutions for different needs - from small startups to big enterprise companies. I've seen a lot of approaches that could be used to solve a task. If you have some doubts whether you are on the right way or not to achieving your goals, please do not hesitate to ask me. Even if your task is not my speciality, I can recommend you some of my friends or suggest some solution \"from the box\" that I've seen during my work career.\n\n     Let me describe some of my skills that I can offer you:\n\n1. Java web development.  I'm a fullstack developer and can deal with both backend and frontend parts. \n\n2. Creating crawlers (parsers). I use Java stack to create all sorts of scraping utils that can emulate any real user behavior. Your website requires auth and is equipped with anti-scraper shield? We can easily handle with it!\n\n3. All types of javascript/nodejs tools. You need to create nodejs utility or REST service? Ping me and you\u2019ll get the result in the shortest terms.\n\n4. Any sort of Java utils. Need to automate some business process? Easily. Contact me and we will discuss a solution.\n\nThat was a short snapshot of what I do here on upwork. If you realise that something you want is not in this list please don\u2019t hesitate to ask me. We can discuss your problem and there is almost 95% chance that I\u2019ll offer you a solution or give you a contact of a guy who can solve your task.\n\nWhat differs me from other freelancers? Here is what I can promise you:\n\n1. Even if I\u2019m unable to solve your task I can recommend my friends freelancers who know the technology stack that you are interested in.\n\n2. I can warn you If you are taking a wrong way and there is a simpler solution. It can save your time and money.\n\n3. I\u2019m available from 11AM UTC up to 2AM UTC (I work in UTC +3 timezone). This means that I\u2019m always online and can answer your questions. There won\u2019t be any long pauses in communication.\n\n4. My goal is to complete a project successfully. I never reject a project in the middle saying something like \u201cThis is not possible\u201d or \u201cThis is to difficult I\u2019d rather find another one\u201d. This means that every difficulty I face I\u2019ll report to you and we will discuss a solution or workaround. This point is very important for fixed price jobs.\n\n5. And finally one more thing that worth mentioning - my first priority is quality rather than speed. This means that when I say that a project will be completed in 3 days you will receive clear, well-written and maintainable code after these 3 days.\n\n      Here is a short overview of my working experience. I created several successful projects for .NET platform with C# programming language. After that I was invited to work as a team lead and developed a medicine project. I was responsible for maintaining and writing new functionality, creating technical tasks, guiding my team and communication with a customer.\n    Having finished this project I joined another team as a team lead and here we developed a complex enterprise project. It was a SaaS services for the US law companies. Here I received a great experience in working with different javascript frameworks. I also had to work a bit as a Java developer in this company on a side project.\n     My next (and last) step was the decision to change the technology stack from .NET to Java and I joined a small startup that was building some kind of global information system. That has been a high load project built with Java stack (backend) and custom speed oriented backbone-based javascript framework.\nI joined the project as a Senior Java Developer and in a few years I became a System Architect.\n\nHere is list of technologies that I\u2019ve worked with:\n\nServer side stack:\n\n- Java Core: JavaSE, JavaEE, Multithreading, Collections API, etc\n- Server: Tomcat, GlashFish, Java Servlets, Nexus deployment, continuous integration\n- Frameworks: Spring, Spring Security, Spring MVC\n- Database layer(ORM): Hibernate, JPA\n- DataBases: PostgreSQL, MSSQL, DB2\n- Testing frameworks: TestNG, JUnit, Selenium\n- Builing tools: Gradle, Maven, Nexus\n- Addtional: NodeJS, PhantomJS\n\nClient side stack:\n\n- Mark-up: HTML5, CCS3 (LESS/SASS), Bootstrap, Responsive Web Design (RWD)\n- Javascript: JavaScript/Coffescript, Ajax, jQuery, jQueryUI, Underscore, RequireJS, Sammy\n- Frameworks: AngularJS, Backbone, KnockoutJS\n- Testing tools: QUnit, Mocha\n- Profiling tools: Chrome network profiler, DynaTrace Ajax\n\nVersion control systems:\n\n- SVN, Git, Mercurial, TFS\n\n\nI thank you for reading my overview and I\u2019m looking forward to working with you.\n\nAlexey", "name": "Alex S.", "last_activity": "September 16, 2017", "rate": "40.0", "member_since": "January 30, 2015", "portfolio_items_count": "2", "id": "~014681a83c5d052e53", "test_passed_count": "6", "feedback": "5.0"}, {"portrait_50": "https://odesk-prod-portraits.s3.amazonaws.com/Users:maciejzakrzewski:PortraitUrl_50?AWSAccessKeyId=1XVAX3FNQZAFC9GJCFR2&Expires=2147483647&Signature=kvYtO8Rmcjvzuc%2BHCDqWaSnZSRQ%3D", "categories2": ["Web, Mobile & Software Dev"], "profile_type": "Agency", "title": "Senior Laravel / Symfony Developer", "skills": ["php", "python", "c++", "symfony", "django-framework", "java", "angularjs", "webgl", "mysql", "javascript"], "country": "Poland", "description": "I started programming as a kid, and it\u2019s been 20 years now. My first language was Pascal, then C/C++ and then I moved on to interpreted languages, like PHP or Python. My professional career in web programming began 5 years ago: since then I delivered dozens of web applications in PHP (Symfony, Laravel) and Python (Django), among others.\n\nI treat my experience as a responsibility: I know what works and what doesn\u2019t and I am able to judge the consequences of many technological choices - that\u2019s why I am always honest and realistic with my clients, offer my advice, and if necessary, try to dissuade them from solutions that might not work as they have envisioned.\n\nMy main focus is on code quality and practicality - it is my ambition is to write code that will be reliable, fast, easy to modify, and written in relatively short time. I always go for balance between perfection and practicality in my coding (since the road to perfection is infinite and time till deadline is not). I am a strong proponent of the code that can be documented by its contents and unit tests only. \n\nI am also a fast learner - I don\u2019t treat any framework as anything more than another tool that\u2019s made for convenience. When the need arises I can learn most of programming libraries and frameworks on the spot (as long it\u2019s in a programming language I know). I always enjoy a new challenge!\n\nMy technical expertise covers:\n- Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, MongoDB\n- VCS: Git, SVN\n- Issue trackers: Asana, Redmine, Trello, Jira, Harvest\n- Hosting: AWS, Linode, CPANEL/WHM, GoDaddy\n- Server OSes and tools: GNU/Linux (distributions: Ubuntu, Arch, Fedora, OpenSUSE, \n  Gentoo), FreeBSD, Apache2, Nginx (php-fpm and uwsgi), Postfix, supervisor\n- Code quality: PHPUnit, Python unittest  (also in conjunction with Django)\n- Search: ElasticSearch, Solr\n- API: experience in Symfony, Laravel, Django and Node.js\n- 3D graphics programming: OpenGL in JS WebGL and C/C++ OpenGL\n- Others: Websockets (mostly with Django, Laravel and Ratchet). \n\nMy technology stack:\nBackend: \n- PHP(5 and 7): Laravel, Symfony \n- Python(2 and 3):  Django \n- JS: Node.js\nFrontend: HTML5, JavaScript (ES6), jQuery, Three.js, CSS, SASS, LESS, NPM, grunt, bower, gulp, Angular 1, Bootstrap\nCMS: Wordpress, Joomla (1.5, 2.x and 3.x), OpenCart (1 and 2)\n\nIf you are looking for a reliable business partner, I have good news for you:\nI work with Polcode Software House - one of the top rated agencies on Upwork, located in Poland (EU).

I have a lot of experience in many areas, a result of both my professional career as well as my own personal projects.\n\nDetailed profile information can be found at http://profile.rilhas.com\n\nI can design, test, and manufacture hardware (including PCBs) using microcontrollers, FPGAs, USB, UART, I2C, and many more, and integrate them with computers, embedded systems, mains power, motors, various sensors, etc.. It is not uncommon for hardware projects in which I\u2019m involved to incorporate both firmware and software, or even connect to the internet or with mobile phones.\n\nI have a lot of experience in the PC world, both as a user and as a developer. I have developed high density ISDN telephony application servers (IVRs) for the main Portuguese telecom operator, with an installed base of over 2000 channels, including a voice mail system complete with voice and text fault-proof database. I have developed a large number of computer systems, both servers and clients.\n\nMy work with IVR's later included testing and using various ASR and TTS technologies (for automatic speech recognition and automatic speech synthesis from the major providers like Loquendo, Nuance, Philips), applied to various areas from the IVR system themselves (directory assistance, flight booking, and more), a help support system for the elderly (consisting of an emergency telephone help server for the national Red Cross), all the way to systems for the hearing impaired (integrating with JAWS screen reader, for example).\n\nI have worked with a team to develop a tool for airport management systems, where my contribution was the development of a complete graphics subsystem based on OpenGL, which is being used up to this date (more than 10 years later), due to its capabilities not having yet been surpassed by the competition.\n\nI've developed technology to analyze video images and detect a large number of situations, including FOD at an airport in A\u00e7ores, intrusion detection, early fire warning systems (marketed as CICLOPE), fire prevention systems at PORTUCEL (one of the main producer of paper and other products), illegal car parking, subterranean bus parking, automatic lane management (and infraction detection) on the 25 de Abril Bridge, and many more.\n\nI also developed technology to monitor and track bird movements using radar data. A first version used the radar image, and a more recent version uses the raw radar data (captured using a high speed data acquisition system that I also developed specifically for the radars being used). Since this system requires the display of large amounts of data (images with 30+ MPix) I also developed the visualization component (based on OpenGL).\n\nI also have some experience in CAD modeling (owing mainly to the fact that I've owned a 3D printer for several years), with which I have created numerous models for small production runs of plastic objects, mainly to assist with electronics projects but which I have also used successfully to create inexpensive plastic connectors and other components for a company that manufactures and installs solar pool heating systems, including automated 2\" valves. I\u2019ve also created custom shaped plastic cookie cutters for my wife and toys for my son. :-)\n\nI've produced several promotional 3D videos for a few companies, and I also recorded and produced music albums for a number of artists.\n\nThe systems I have developed in the past make use of (of have integrated with) a wide range of languages, systems, and technologies, including C, C++, C#, JAVA, J2ME, Android, Javascript, Ruby, PIC 10/12/16/24 assembly, i386 assembly, MMX/SSE2, Verilog, TCP/IP, UDP, OpenGL, USB, WiFi, Bluetooth, Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone Black, Windows, Linux, POTS, ISDN, ASR, TTS, among many others.\n\nMany of the projects I've worked on have included other people, and I have been the project manager on most of them. For the larger projects where I was not the project manager (like those involving airport security, for example) I was the team leader of the corresponding project component.\n\nGiven my extensive experience with complex and innovative projects (where a solution is not always obvious from the start and a great deal of creativity is need as the project progresses), I have also developed good skills and intuition for preventing and detecting bugs, both at a code testing stage as well as (more importantly) at a design or specification stage.
