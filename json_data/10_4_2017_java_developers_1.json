This may also involve merging the client's metadata (internal domain data) with external 3rd party data sources such as data from Google Analytics, social media or even publicly available data (Ex: Zillow)\n- Perform data masking or obfuscation if necessary\n- Process the input data using Python and Apache Spark (as an example)\n- Persist them in a database (NoSQL, or relational). Documentation of the mapping from the source data to target database schemas from where further analysis can be done. \n- Perform targeted data analysis that meets the client's objectives. This may involve descriptive and predictive analysis on the data (A popular use case for descriptive analytics involves core KPI dashboards, and for predictive analytics involves forecasting using historical data) \n- Design UI dashboards, and code front-end apps on NodeJS/AngularJS/D3 that deliver the data and visualizations which help us answer the questions that prompted the data engineering effort\n- Deploy the solution to AWS or the Google Cloud\n- Document/create user stories, specifications for product development, solution approaches and design documentation that can be consumed by a technical audience for implementation.\n\nIn my previous jobs, I have also been a product manager and an application architect and have worked with employers such as AT&T, Inc., a large corporation to a much smaller consulting firm like Saggezza, Inc.

My main areas of expertise are: Python, PHP, JAVA, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Machine Learning areas like NLP, Data Mining, Recommendation Systems, Document Classification. I have rich experience in both writing functional scripts and system architecture design. \n\nOver the last ten years I have developed hundreds of scraping scripts/applications and several custom topical search engines, including news search based on perspectives, recipe search for ingredients in the fridge and health conditions, IT job search for easy team building with complementary skills, etc. \n\nBy learning about IR, I got good at SEO. And vice versa, by experimenting, reading papers and patents from Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, etc, optimizing dozens of websites, through SEO I learned a bit about IR as well  :)\n\nI do SEO audit where I focus on crucial issues and changes with most impact and ROI. I brought several websites from 0 to 100k+ visits per month with on-page SEO and very little or no off-page SEO. In my keyword research I use six tools made by Google or based on Google data, three tools I developed (two using machine learning), and several other well know keyword tools. However, I do not overwhelm you with thousands of phrases found, but select only the top ones most useful for increasing rankings of your particular site based on its current SERP rankings. Social media became quite important for SEO, so when needed I can help with social media marketing, specifically Instagram marketing. \n\nFor the NetflixPrize competition I independently came up with a common sense approach to collaborative filtering, named by others 'Slope One'. \n\nI combine my algorithms and open source packages and add a bit of my own twist to them to solve the problems I encounter. \n\nIn the spare time I work on researching and developing educational software and collaboration tools, and participate on specialized conferences with such inspiring people like collaborators of the late inventor of \"The Mother of All Demos\". My first web project was a graph based discussion forum for brainstorming, first one of the kind and, to the extent of my knowledge, dozen years later still the only one. \n\nHave done work with Multi Agent Simulations, and the emergence of complex patterns from simple behavior changes. \n\nIn addition to widely known ML / numeric libraries (NLTK, Scikit, NumPy, Gensim, etc.) I also use less known and proprietary NLP / ML packages.

We talked on a daily basis (oftentimes 2-3 times a day), to talk about progress and going over any questions he or I had. He ships code extremely quickly and always takes the time to make sure that I am updated on what he is doing and what the progress looks like. Xiu also had some great feedback for the design of my app, and we discussed how we could implement his feedback to make my app even better. I love the way the v1 of my app looks and feels - I'm looking forward to working with Xiu on v2!\n\nFurthermore, I also want to emphasize how trustworthy Xiu is. On my 2nd day working with him, I accidentally released the full amount of my fixed price contract to Xiu by mistake when I intended to pay him for a milestone up-front. I messaged Xiu and prayed that somehow I would be able to get my money back (oDesk unfortunately could not cancel the transaction.) The moment that Xiu got my message, he immediately refunded me all the money (less the initial upfront amount we agreed upon.) I was immensely impressed by Xiu's speed and honesty in handling this situation.\n\nI highly recommend hiring Xiu. He is trustworthy, communicative, and great at what he does!

And rather than just giving me my project after it was completed, Nadya called me and made sure that I knew everything about what she had created and spent the time to answer all my questions.\n\nIn short, Nadya is a web programmer of a caliber that is rare and highly sought after. I have absolutely no hesitation asking her to work for me again and I would highly recommend her to anyone that wants quality work from a true professional.

Our website designer provided Photoshop files and Dawn performed her magic by implementing the designs in HubSpot. We worked through a series of project milestones with very tight deadlines. Dawn did an excellent job under pressure and has become a very valuable member of our team over the past year. She provided expert guidance in the beginning of the project and provided a steady and calming presence for our team as the project progressed. We know we can count on Dawn to deliver exactly what she has promised.
