Your job is to run a company - and you're damn good at it. \n\nAttracting paying customers through your blog can be as simple as hitting the big green \u201cHire now\u201d button on the top right.

She finished this lengthy project exactly on schedule, and the results are exactly what I needed. If you are looking for a translator, look no further! Marissa is excellent, and she will not disappoint you.\"\n\nIf you need to translate a document from English into Spanish, or transcribe/translate a Spanish audio/video, then you have arrived at the right place! \n\nI understand it can be quite difficult to trust a person that you don't know (yet) to translate the original message accurately, especially if you don't speak the target language. That's why it's important that you know firsthand that the translations I produce are of the highest quality, accuracy and are grammatically correct. I consistently receive positive feedback; please, read below for some comments left by my clients:\n\n\"Marissa was fantastic when doing my translations. She always communicated deadlines, and was prompt in answering communications.\"\n\n\"Marissa is, first of all, very serious and professional. She does all necessary to ensure that the work she will deliver will be perfect.\"\n\nIf you need to double check translations made by other professionals, I also provide editing/proofreading services. I'll make sure that the translation is not only correct and accurate, but that it also flows naturally. I can also proofread your Spanish texts and make sure they are error-free.\n\n\"Marissa went above and beyond to complete the work. She also helped me realize that a translator I previously trusted had many inaccuracies. I respect her hard work and great attention to detail, and only wish she spoke all of the other languages as well!\"\n\nI specialize in:\n- Legal,\n- Financial, \n- Marketing, and\n- Business translations.\n\nHowever, I also enjoy translating other types of texts, such as those related to:\n- Technical/User Manuals,\n- Non-fiction e-books,\n- Religion,\n- Nutrition, \n- Fitness, \n- Gastronomy, \n- Tourism/Travel, and\n- Hospitality.\n\n\"Job completed on time, error free and surpassing my expectations. Will definitely recommend to anyone seeking a professional translator!\"\n\nIf what you need is a transcript, it's equally important that you get a guarantee that the transcripts are accurate and error-free, especially if these transcripts are going to be used for legal cases. If you are going to transcribe a video or audio it's because the content is really important and an inaccurate transcript would be worthless. \n\nI have transcribed:\n- Documentaries,\n- Interviews, \n- Police interrogations, \n- 911 calls, \n- Interviews, \n- Podcasts, \n- Seminars, \n- Focus groups, etc. \n\nConfidentiality is really important for my clients, therefore, I can't provide samples of my transcripts.  However, I'd naturally be very happy to perform a short sample transcription of your choosing to showcase my skills.\n\nThe following comment was left by one of my clients, a large transcription company in the USA, after I finished the first transcription/translation I did for them:\n\n\"As my proofreader said \"Wow! This is . . . perfect!\" Great job, excellent communicator, very nice, quick turnaround. She is fantastic. Thank you for a great job, Marissa!\"\n\nAnd other clients said:\n\n\"Marissa is amazing!!! The quality of her work is excellent . Her communication and attention to every detail of the project makes her my first choice everytime.\"\n\n\"Marissa is extremely hard-working and definitely up for a challenge. She makes the effort to research details and make her transcripts as accurate as possible. Thank you!\"\n\nI invite you to contact me and tell me about the project you'd like me to work on.

Full of techniques and tricks in drawing and coding macro, and always think out of the box to get best result. Known as 'Anjaz' on the net.\n\u201cAnjaz continues to play a pivotal role in the graphic design work at our company. \u201d\n\u201cAnjaz has transformed our graphic design department. \u201d \u2014 BissellBrothersBrew\n\u201cOnce again, Anjaz has done a spectacular job. This is the third or fourth time we've used him for Corel Macros and every time has gone above and beyond to get us a GREAT product. Very, Very quick responses and as always, comes up with even better features that I originally was looking for. If Anjaz has submitted a proposal for your job STOP NOW and hire him! I don't even do RFP's anymore for macros... I go straight to Anjaz!\u201d\n\u2014 newwiremarine\n\nDec 2014 - Jan 2015 - CorelDRAW macro to auto-generate drawings\nI rarely give full 5 start ratings b/c there is always room to improve. I am an American business owner, and have used elance extensively. Anjez is the BEST find I've had on here. I've used him for multiple projects and anything corelDRAW or macro related I go STRAIGHT to him. He is incredible with corel (and I've got VERY good people on my staff). He is an excellent macro programmer, and does things I never knew were possible. On several projects he has gone above and beyond to understand by business \"need\" (not just completing the requirements I out line in the RFP) and has designed innovative solutions to meet the need much more than I could have even described in an RFQ. He makes things very clear with detailed \"operating manuals\" essentially, and even videos showing how to use his macros. This is the longest feedback I've every written b/c I truly appreciate his efforts. You're probably reading this b/c he has given you a proposal... if so... look no further, AWARD HIM YOUR JOB! Thanks for the excellent support Anjez!!\n\nJan 2015 - Corel Draw x7 Macro\nWOW same day delivery! Super fast communication and very friendly! Will use again for my macro needs!\n\nDec 2014 -CorelDraw X6 VBA macro\nIf you need macros for CorelDraw ask Anjaz.\n\nNov 2014 - Dec 2014- Cutout Name Necklace design generator\nExcellent work and follow up. I will absolutely work with Anjaz again.\n\nOct 2014 - Need a VBA Macro created in CorelDraw X7\nAnjaz was great to work with. He is definitely very knowledgeable in CorelDraw Macros, as he was able to get us exactly what we needed to streamline some of our processes! I would highly recommend him to anyone!\n\nOct 2014 - Coreldraw x7 Macro\nExactly what we needed! Completed the job in less time than we expected.\n\nSep 2014 - VBA Macro for CorelDraw x7\nIn one word, outstanding. Has surpassed all my expectations. Will definitely work on a recurring basis with Anjaz.\n\nJul 2014 - Corel Draw VBA Script Automation\nExcellent service on every level!\n\nJul 2014 - Create a macro in Coreldraw X6\nAnjaz turned around my macro creation job in an amazingly quick time. The final work was excellent and exactly what I wanted. I have no hesitation in recommending his skills and will be back in time to ask him to work for me again. Five star service!\n\nMay 2014 - Jun 2014 - Image creation script\neasy to communicate, quick delivery and great support :)\n\nApr 2014 - Image editing - CorelDRAW template design\nVery impressed. EXCELLENT skills in CorelDRAW. Only person that took my requirement and actually proposed a feature I didn't even know existed within corel.  This elancer read my RFP, and thought out of the box, proposing a solution that will greatly enhance my business for years to come.  Very responsive (like within an hour) to every single question. I was the only person keeping this project from being done within a day I'd guess.  Not the cheapest proposal but worth every dollar b/c of all the added value.  Thank you!\n\nJul 2013 - Corel Draw X5 Batch processor\nWorked very diligently with me on this project and it was finished to high expectations. Came out with many more capabilities than was originally requested. Have another project that this one led into and am rehiring.

My focus is on helping them design robust business models, develop clear and compelling value propositions, conduct market assessments that demonstrate the problem / needs, perform benchmarking of the relevant competitors, and develop prudent go-to-market approach. I work together with my clients in order to prepare them for the meetings with investors, partners and clients. \n\nI have been advising venture capital funds and corporations on investments, feasibility studies and acquisitions with top consulting companies like A.T.Kearney and KPMG. I managed projects with total value of more than 2 billion dollars, in multiple sectors and in more than 15 countries in Europe, Latin America and Noth America. Working at corporate level with CEOs, Directors and investors, I know \"what\" and \"how\" to present to potential investors and partners.  \n\nIn working with my clients, the guiding principles are professional integrity, honesty and effort to walk the extra mile. There are no ready to apply solutions for developing business plans or preparing for fundraising - every business, value proposition, business model, competitive situation and market trends are combined in a unique manner. We need a structured approach and readiness to break some \"common wisdoms\" in order to design our road to the success. I am ready to help my clients with all the knowledge and experience accumulated in more than 20 years working with exceptional clients and colleagues. My website for the Spanish speaking clients is suStartUp.com. Additionally I am leading a boutique focused on cross-border M&A - eeinetwork.com \n\nI have an MBA from IESE, ranked by Financial Times as #7 in the World, ahead of schools like MIT, Kellog, Berkeley, Chicago, etc. \n\nOn Upwork tests I am among the Top 10% for Venture Capital Consulting, Financial Analysis, Marketing Research and Management Skills.\n\nWith regard to the project execution, one of the key success factors is the fluent and open communication with my clients. I also understand that the time is one of the most precious resources an entrepreneur has, and we have to optimize its usage. My approach to project development is the following:\n\n1.\tAfter an initial conference call to get a feeling about the business, I will prepare and send a list of questions that will help us prepare the business plan or the pitch deck. \n\n2.\tWhile my client reads the questions and prepares the answers, I will review the existing documentation about the project (draft pitch deck, business plans, notes, etc.)\n\n3.\tWe will have a conference call of about 1:30 to 2:00 hours to go through the list of questions and get deeper into the value proposition, the target clients and the business model.\n\n4.\tI will prepare a first draft of a document and we will have a second conference call to go through it and better focus the sections that need changes, and will start adding some new information (market sizing, competitive benchmarking, etc.)\n\n5.\tBased on this second conference call and the study of the market and the competitors, I will produce a second draft. With this the main part of the analytical work will be done.\n\n6.\tThis will prepare us for the development of the financial model that will support our business plan / pitch deck. We have to know where we want to be in three or five years, and how we are going to get there in order to develop a model that will help us play with scenarios. The financial model introduces some discipline to the assumptions and the relations between the different variables, and helps you estimate the percentage of the capital you can give the investors in exchange for their money.   \n\n7.\tOnce we played with the model (scenarios) and probably adjusted some of the assumptions and approaches developed in the second draft of the document, we are ready to prepare the final version of our document and finalize the project. \n\nThis is a general approach to the project implementation. Depending on the project focus and level of preparation of my clients, we can take a different approach for some projects. \n", "education": {"institution": [{"ed_to": "01/1999", "ed_area": "", "ed_school": "IESE Business School", "ed_comment": "Ranked #7 by Financial Times, ahead of Business schools like MIT, Kellog, Berkeley, Chicago, etc.", "ed_from": "01/1997", "ed_degree": "Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.)"}, {"ed_to": "12/1992", "ed_area": "Corporate Finance", "ed_school": "Nottingham Trent University", "ed_comment": "", "ed_from": "01/1992", "ed_degree": ""}]}, "dev_portrait_50": "https://odesk-prod-portraits.s3.amazonaws.com/Users:tvelev:PortraitUrl_50?AWSAccessKeyId=1XVAX3FNQZAFC9GJCFR2&Expires=2147483647&Signature=v4i6jgdZCkdf5mMTmWSg3Qo%2BlZU%3D", "assignments": {"hr": {"job": [{"as_total_hours": "9.33", "as_rate": "$130.00", "as_financial_privacy": "0", "as_to": "Present", "as_from_full": "09/19/2017", "as_ciphertext_opening_recno": "~014316c31c3f27be8b", "as_total_hours_precise": "9.33333333", "as_opening_title": "Pitch Deck Engine", "as_job_type": "Hourly", "as_agency_name": "", "as_to_full": "Present", "as_total_charge": "0"}, {"as_total_hours": "0.50", "as_rate": "$130.00", "as_financial_privacy": "0", "as_to": "Present", "as_from_full": "09/17/2017", "as_ciphertext_opening_recno": "~015c26c27f70f7a528", "as_total_hours_precise": "0.5", "as_opening_title": "Business plan/ pitch deck etc.", "as_job_type": "Hourly", "as_agency_name": "", "as_to_full": "Present", "as_total_charge": "65"}, {"as_to": "Present", "as_rate": "$130.00", "as_total_hours": "0.00", "as_total_hours_precise": "0", "as_opening_title": "A-Listers Wanted as Mentors on Advisory Board for Ambitious Crypto Venture", "as_job_type": "Hourly", "as_to_full": "Present"}, {"as_to": "09/2017", "as_rate": "$130.00", "as_total_charge": "2253.33", "as_total_hours": "17", "as_total_hours_precise": "17.33333334", "as_opening_title": "Fundraising pitch deck specialist", "as_job_type": "Hourly", "as_to_full": "09/21/2017"}, {"as_total_hours": "6.67", "as_rate": "$130.00", "feedback": {"comment": "Todor is a high level thinker and planner who quickly grasped my business concept and re-presented it as requested.
