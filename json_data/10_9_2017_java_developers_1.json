Which technologies to use ? , etc. Ping me, we will discuss about your needs then i'll propose solutions , then among them you can choose best fit according to you, then we will get started with that and i'll deliver amazing products asap.\n\nI am almost an expert of Google Apps Script specially for Google Spreadsheet and Google Form.\nI started freelancing few months ago as an Web Developer but I started feeling more inclined and interested towards Google App script , may be that's because I love Algorithms. Anyways, I have done around 40 jobs related to Google App Script and Google Spreadsheet and or Google Forms.\nBeside writing scripts for several jobs, I have built few automated systems also for my clients. For example,  Automated Feedback System \u2013 This works in the following ways : on the completion of projects supervisors fills a form with the details of client. Then an automated email is sent to the client asking for a brief review, if his/her review score is more than 80% then after three days another email is sent automatically asking for a bit detailed review. This also includes several other things such as maintaining central dashboard, sending automated email when project is published on the site, etc. \nAnother example is an Automated Recruiting System - in that firstly applicants fills a form if they score more than threshold score then their data is sent to recruiter and they are sent a thank you email and so on.\nSo If you have any job related to Google App Scripts/Google Spreadsheet/Google Forms then I can help you for sure.\n\nI also design custom Google form with image upload fields.\n\nMy skills are:- \n\n* Google App Script for Google Custom Web App , Google Drive , Google Form , Google Spreadsheet , etc\n* For backend PHP & MySQL\n* Responsiveness with Bootstrap\n* Styling using css , javascript\n* Dynamic Animation using jQuery\n* Formstack , Google Forms for the forms to take survey , feedback , Quote Request , Reservation Request , etc . I can also build a custom form using HTML, css , jQuery , PHP , MySQL , etc and also add functionality to it as per your requirements.\n\nThese are my previous clients feedback :-   \n\n\"Outstanding experience!

Which technologies to use ? , etc. Ping me, we will discuss about your needs then i'll propose solutions , then among them you can choose best fit according to you, then we will get started with that and i'll deliver amazing products asap.\n\nI am almost an expert of Google Apps Script specially for Google Spreadsheet and Google Form.\nI started freelancing few months ago as an Web Developer but I started feeling more inclined and interested towards Google App script , may be that's because I love Algorithms. Anyways, I have done around 40 jobs related to Google App Script and Google Spreadsheet and or Google Forms.\nBeside writing scripts for several jobs, I have built few automated systems also for my clients. For example,  Automated Feedback System \u2013 This works in the following ways : on the completion of projects supervisors fills a form with the details of client. Then an automated email is sent to the client asking for a brief review, if his/her review score is more than 80% then after three days another email is sent automatically asking for a bit detailed review. This also includes several other things such as maintaining central dashboard, sending automated email when project is published on the site, etc. \nAnother example is an Automated Recruiting System - in that firstly applicants fills a form if they score more than threshold score then their data is sent to recruiter and they are sent a thank you email and so on.\nSo If you have any job related to Google App Scripts/Google Spreadsheet/Google Forms then I can help you for sure.\n\nI also design custom Google form with image upload fields.\n\nMy skills are:- \n\n* Google App Script for Google Custom Web App , Google Drive , Google Form , Google Spreadsheet , etc\n* For backend PHP & MySQL\n* Responsiveness with Bootstrap\n* Styling using css , javascript\n* Dynamic Animation using jQuery\n* Formstack , Google Forms for the forms to take survey , feedback , Quote Request , Reservation Request , etc . I can also build a custom form using HTML, css , jQuery , PHP , MySQL , etc and also add functionality to it as per your requirements.\n\nThese are my previous clients feedback :-   \n\n\"Outstanding experience! Umair is a very hard & smart worker. Highly intelligent and capable of developing some truly great applications that 'NO OTHER SELLER ON FIVERR' can create! He made me an automated Google Sheets add-on with some crazy UI features, published the add-on to the Google store and installed it on 170+ computers in my enterprise :)\" - armdragon\n\n\"Perfect work!

Scroll down to job history section   \n\nI'm experienced and specialized in Web & Mobile Development with Designing basically using PHP , MySQL , CSS , Javascript , jQuery.\n\nI also have experience of Designing Google docs such as Google Forms, Google sheets and writing Google App Script related to them and to Google Drive.\n\nI have build/worked on several custom web apps such as Timesheet Management System, Employees/HR Management System, Store Management System, Attendance System, Payslip Generation System.\n\nI have also developed some web pages.\n\nI also love to develop android applications.\n\nI have done 2 projects at TATA, Jamshedpur in which i developed a Hospital Management system and a dashboard using asp.net, c#, ms-access, bootstrap.\n\nI also do competitive programming using JAVA , C , C++\n\nStill learning..\n\nFor my contact details invite me to interview", "education": {"institution": {"ed_to": "01/2017", "ed_area": "Computer Science And Engineering", "ed_school": "B.I.T.
