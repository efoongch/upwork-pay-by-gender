This may also involve merging the client's metadata (internal domain data) with external 3rd party data sources such as data from Google Analytics, social media or even publicly available data (Ex: Zillow)\n- Perform data masking or obfuscation if necessary\n- Process the input data using Python and Apache Spark (as an example)\n- Persist them in a database (NoSQL, or relational). Documentation of the mapping from the source data to target database schemas from where further analysis can be done. \n- Perform targeted data analysis that meets the client's objectives. This may involve descriptive and predictive analysis on the data (A popular use case for descriptive analytics involves core KPI dashboards, and for predictive analytics involves forecasting using historical data) \n- Design UI dashboards, and code front-end apps on NodeJS/AngularJS/D3 that deliver the data and visualizations which help us answer the questions that prompted the data engineering effort\n- Deploy the solution to AWS or the Google Cloud\n- Document/create user stories, specifications for product development, solution approaches and design documentation that can be consumed by a technical audience for implementation.\n\nIn my previous jobs, I have also been a product manager and an application architect and have worked with employers such as AT&T, Inc., a large corporation to a much smaller consulting firm like Saggezza, Inc.

My main areas of expertise are: Python, PHP, JAVA, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Machine Learning areas like NLP, Data Mining, Recommendation Systems, Document Classification. I have rich experience in both writing functional scripts and system architecture design. \n\nOver the last ten years I have developed hundreds of scraping scripts/applications and several custom topical search engines, including news search based on perspectives, recipe search for ingredients in the fridge and health conditions, IT job search for easy team building with complementary skills, etc. \n\nBy learning about IR, I got good at SEO. And vice versa, by experimenting, reading papers and patents from Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, etc, optimizing dozens of websites, through SEO I learned a bit about IR as well  :)\n\nI do SEO audit where I focus on crucial issues and changes with most impact and ROI. I brought several websites from 0 to 100k+ visits per month with on-page SEO and very little or no off-page SEO. In my keyword research I use six tools made by Google or based on Google data, three tools I developed (two using machine learning), and several other well know keyword tools. However, I do not overwhelm you with thousands of phrases found, but select only the top ones most useful for increasing rankings of your particular site based on its current SERP rankings. Social media became quite important for SEO, so when needed I can help with social media marketing, specifically Instagram marketing. \n\nFor the NetflixPrize competition I independently came up with a common sense approach to collaborative filtering, named by others 'Slope One'. \n\nI combine my algorithms and open source packages and add a bit of my own twist to them to solve the problems I encounter. \n\nIn the spare time I work on researching and developing educational software and collaboration tools, and participate on specialized conferences with such inspiring people like collaborators of the late inventor of \"The Mother of All Demos\". My first web project was a graph based discussion forum for brainstorming, first one of the kind and, to the extent of my knowledge, dozen years later still the only one. \n\nHave done work with Multi Agent Simulations, and the emergence of complex patterns from simple behavior changes. \n\nIn addition to widely known ML / numeric libraries (NLTK, Scikit, NumPy, Gensim, etc.) I also use less known and proprietary NLP / ML packages.

We talked on a daily basis (oftentimes 2-3 times a day), to talk about progress and going over any questions he or I had. He ships code extremely quickly and always takes the time to make sure that I am updated on what he is doing and what the progress looks like. Xiu also had some great feedback for the design of my app, and we discussed how we could implement his feedback to make my app even better. I love the way the v1 of my app looks and feels - I'm looking forward to working with Xiu on v2!\n\nFurthermore, I also want to emphasize how trustworthy Xiu is. On my 2nd day working with him, I accidentally released the full amount of my fixed price contract to Xiu by mistake when I intended to pay him for a milestone up-front. I messaged Xiu and prayed that somehow I would be able to get my money back (oDesk unfortunately could not cancel the transaction.) The moment that Xiu got my message, he immediately refunded me all the money (less the initial upfront amount we agreed upon.) I was immensely impressed by Xiu's speed and honesty in handling this situation.\n\nI highly recommend hiring Xiu. He is trustworthy, communicative, and great at what he does!

On my own, I can handle the full process:\n\n- gathering requirements (communication is such a vital part of the software development process!), keeping track of tasks and ideas via Jira, documenting all progress\n\n- R&D, analyzing feasibility, prototyping\n\n- Planning for testability\n\n- Building the backend: web crawling, collecting data from third-party APIs, cleaning data, storing data in SQL and/or noSQL, making data searchable, making data accessible via APIs, etc. (my languages of choice for building backend components are Java and Clojure)\n\n- Building the tricky parts of the backend: I can handle some Machine Learning and some Natural Language Processing when I need to\n\n- Building the frontend. I use jQuery in the case of a more \"standard\" \"business\" application, and ClojureScript if complex frontend functionality is needed\n\n- Deploying the application, doing the necessary server administration. I know Linux well, and have used the Amazon Web Services\n\n- Maintaining the application once it has real users\n\n- The one thing with which I might need help is graphic design, although in simpler cases I can handle that on my own as well\n\nI am looking forward to hearing about your project: maybe we could build it together!", "education": {"institution": {"ed_to": "01/2003", "ed_area": "Mathematics", "ed_school": "UPMC", "ed_comment": "", "ed_from": "01/1998", "ed_degree": "Bachelor of Applied Science (B.A.Sc.)"}}, "dev_portrait_50": "https://odesk-prod-portraits.s3.amazonaws.com/Users:yotsov:PortraitUrl_50?AWSAccessKeyId=1XVAX3FNQZAFC9GJCFR2&Expires=2147483647&Signature=G9FSNcxg9W5rvE%2BfwZnkWfoGvrw%3D&1467188492765926", "assignments": {"hr": {"job": {"as_to": "Present", "as_rate": "$30.00", "as_total_charge": "720", "as_total_hours": "24", "as_from_full": "10/24/2016", "as_ciphertext_opening_recno": "~01e7cfa2ad233c7f76", "as_total_hours_precise": "24", "as_opening_title": "Cable operator business, Internal portals and services, Clojure/ClojureScript", "as_job_type": "Hourly", "as_to_full": "Present", "as_agency_name": "", "as_financial_privacy": "0"}}, "fp": {"job": {"as_total_hours": "0.00", "as_rate": "$0.00", "feedback": {"comment": "", "score": "5.00", "scores": {"score": [{"score": "5", "description": "competency and skills for the job, understanding of specifications/instructions", "label": "Skills"}, {"score": "5", "description": "quality of work deliverables", "label": "Quality"}, {"score": "5", "description": "online presence on a consistent schedule", "label": "Availability"}, {"score": "5", "description": "ability to complete tasks on time", "label": "Deadlines"}, {"score": "5", "description": "communication skills, frequent progress updates, responsiveness", "label": "Communication"}, {"score": "5", "description": "cooperation and flexibility, suggestions for improvement", "label": "Cooperation"}]}}, "as_to": "09/2017", "as_total_hours_precise": "0", "as_opening_title": "Data scientist / developer for advanced analytics platform", "as_job_type": "Fixed", "as_to_full": "09/30/2017"}}}, "dev_portfolio_items_v2_count": "0", "dev_adj_score": "5", "dev_billed_assignments": "2", "dev_portrait_100": "https://odesk-prod-portraits.s3.amazonaws.com/Users:yotsov:PortraitUrl_100?AWSAccessKeyId=1XVAX3FNQZAFC9GJCFR2&Expires=2147483647&Signature=lVhTOAnpwbNlWpQKBDiYv8P51QA%3D&1467188492765926", "dev_recno": "12044498", "dev_portrait_32": "https://odesk-prod-portraits.s3.amazonaws.com/Users:yotsov:PortraitUrl_32?AWSAccessKeyId=1XVAX3FNQZAFC9GJCFR2&Expires=2147483647&Signature=QFxlGI77w5wJ1fetd8aiFu6H1R4%3D&1467188492765926", "portfolio_items": "", "dev_bill_rate": "30.00", "permalink": "", "dev_last_worked": "September 30, 2017", "dev_timezone": "UTC+02:00 Eastern Europe", "dev_portfolio_items_count": "0", "tsexams": {"tsexam": {"ts_percentile": "95", "ts_duration": "19", "ts_pass": "1", "ts_name_raw": "U.S. English Basic Skills", "ts_score": "4.6000000000000000", "ts_id": "14647887", "ts_when": "06/29/2016"}}, "ciphertext": "~010db9e46387ce9c85", "dev_eng_skill": "", "dev_last_activity": "October 4, 2017", "skills": {"skill": [{"skl_name": "api-development", "skl_external_link": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface", "skl_rank": "6", "skl_has_tests": "0", "skl_description": "An application programming interface (API) is a source code based specification intended to be used as an interface by software components to communicate with each other.

Software Development is more than a career for me: it's my passion. I love what I do, and I spare no effort to deliver excellent software products.\n\nMy specialty is on Full-stack Web Development (Web applications,. Distributed systems, Scalability, Web Services, APIs, Server Infrastructure).\n\nI put effort towards writing clean, well-written code, because I believe that code quality matters. In order to achieve the highest level of quality, excellence is necessary, even in the things you can't see. So I am very detailed-oriented in every aspect of my work.\n\nOver the years, I've realized that if you follow a short set of rules (and stick to them!!) your projects will always succeed. These are my 6 rules for successful projects.\n\n 1. Never stop learning (always keep up to date)\n 2. Hard work and consistency (never procrastinate, because later = never)\n 3. Organization and cleanliness (organize all tasks and keep them up-to-date)\n 4. Quality in everything, even in the things clients don't see\n 5. Clear and constant communication\n 6. Discuss everything up front (schedules, requirements, problems, solutions, etc)\n\nI hope these will help you on your future projects. Send me a message in you're interested in discussing how to take your projects and ideas to the next level.\n\nABOUT MY EXPERIENCE\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about my experience as a Software Developer, the following few paragraphs describe my history as a developer in some detail.\n\nFor my first 10 years developing software (1995 \u2013 2005), I focused on game development using C/C++, Python, LUA, Assembly Language, OpenGL, DirectX, etc. This was very low-level programming, which is completely different from Web Development, because it deals very closely with memory, the CPU and GPU, and other low-level computer concepts. I specifically focused in 3D Computer Graphics and Game Logic. To this day, I consider that this experience shaped me to become the professional that I am today.\n\nOver the next 12 years (2005 - Present) I've focused on mobile & web development, using a myriad of languages (PHP, Python, Ruby, Javascript, Java, Groovy, Objective-C, Swift, CSS, HTML) and a myriad of frameworks (Django, Laravel, Code Igniter, Flask, Ruby on Rails, Groovy on Grails) and many other front-end frameworks (jQuery UI, AngularJS, ReactJS, ExtJS).\n\nI'm also the founder and chief software architect of LionMane Software, a small development studio where I spearhead a specialized team of developers focused on full-stack web development. We specialize in creating software products for web and mobile platforms.\n\nAs of today, I use the following languages & technologies, which I'm strongly experienced with:\n\n\u2022 PHP and Python for backend development\n\u2022 Javascript, jQuery, AngularJS, AJAX, JSON, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS (LESS and SASS)\n\u2022 RESTful APIs (Producing and Consuming)\n\u2022 GIT (Github and Bitbucket)\n\u2022 Database and Server programming\n\u2022 Laravel, CodeIgniter, Django, Flask\n\u2022 iOS app development with Swift and Objective-C\n\nI hope this was informative for you, and if you'd like a full version of my Resum\u00e9, please don't hesitate to write. I look forward to working with you to take your projects to the next level.\n\nSincerely,\nMario J.
