I own a personal licence of SolidWorks which includes version 14 through 17.\n\nI am a full time freelancer on Upwork.\n\nCommunication is key.  I always strive to clearly understand my clients needs before starting any project to make sure we are in agreement on what the final product should be.\n\nLet me help your design be a success!\n\nPS: I do not do graphics or product renderings, I'm severely colorblind.

Whether your project is the layout of a 72-page magazine, a suite of branding pieces, or a conference brochure, I will approach it with \"big picture\" eyes. Aesthetics must meet practicality. Layout must meet purpose and function. Words should be clever, yet concise enough to answer every key question.\n\nI will treat your project with the utmost\u200b respect and, of course, timeliness is essential. Your project's success begins with my careful listening \u2013 to your specs, ideas and needs. \n\nWith 15+ years in the field, I am poised and experienced enough to take projects from concept (i.e., brand identity) to completion (print, post).\n\nI look forward to working with you and am excited about the success of your upcoming project!

She finished this lengthy project exactly on schedule, and the results are exactly what I needed. If you are looking for a translator, look no further! Marissa is excellent, and she will not disappoint you.\"\n\nIf you need to translate a document from English into Spanish, or transcribe/translate a Spanish audio/video, then you have arrived at the right place! \n\nI understand it can be quite difficult to trust a person that you don't know (yet) to translate the original message accurately, especially if you don't speak the target language. That's why it's important that you know firsthand that the translations I produce are of the highest quality, accuracy and are grammatically correct. I consistently receive positive feedback; please, read below for some comments left by my clients:\n\n\"Marissa was fantastic when doing my translations. She always communicated deadlines, and was prompt in answering communications.\"\n\n\"Marissa is, first of all, very serious and professional. She does all necessary to ensure that the work she will deliver will be perfect.\"\n\nIf you need to double check translations made by other professionals, I also provide editing/proofreading services. I'll make sure that the translation is not only correct and accurate, but that it also flows naturally. I can also proofread your Spanish texts and make sure they are error-free.\n\n\"Marissa went above and beyond to complete the work. She also helped me realize that a translator I previously trusted had many inaccuracies. I respect her hard work and great attention to detail, and only wish she spoke all of the other languages as well!\"\n\nI specialize in:\n- Legal,\n- Financial, \n- Marketing, and\n- Business translations.\n\nHowever, I also enjoy translating other types of texts, such as those related to:\n- Technical/User Manuals,\n- Non-fiction e-books,\n- Religion,\n- Nutrition, \n- Fitness, \n- Gastronomy, \n- Tourism/Travel, and\n- Hospitality.\n\n\"Job completed on time, error free and surpassing my expectations. Will definitely recommend to anyone seeking a professional translator!\"\n\nIf what you need is a transcript, it's equally important that you get a guarantee that the transcripts are accurate and error-free, especially if these transcripts are going to be used for legal cases. If you are going to transcribe a video or audio it's because the content is really important and an inaccurate transcript would be worthless. \n\nI have transcribed:\n- Documentaries,\n- Interviews, \n- Police interrogations, \n- 911 calls, \n- Interviews, \n- Podcasts, \n- Seminars, \n- Focus groups, etc. \n\nConfidentiality is really important for my clients, therefore, I can't provide samples of my transcripts.  However, I'd naturally be very happy to perform a short sample transcription of your choosing to showcase my skills.\n\nThe following comment was left by one of my clients, a large transcription company in the USA, after I finished the first transcription/translation I did for them:\n\n\"As my proofreader said \"Wow! This is . . . perfect!\" Great job, excellent communicator, very nice, quick turnaround. She is fantastic. Thank you for a great job, Marissa!\"\n\nAnd other clients said:\n\n\"Marissa is amazing!!! The quality of her work is excellent . Her communication and attention to every detail of the project makes her my first choice everytime.\"\n\n\"Marissa is extremely hard-working and definitely up for a challenge. She makes the effort to research details and make her transcripts as accurate as possible. Thank you!\"\n\nI invite you to contact me and tell me about the project you'd like me to work on.

With excellent communication skills and the ability to work independently, I have gained a lot of experience by working directly with clients and handling projects individually. I have a thorough knowledge and understanding of advanced development methodologies, and I am able to provide meaningful contributions in the design, installation, testing and maintenance of many types of software systems. Working from initial concepts through to the delivery and implementation of cutting-edge software solutions, I am often involved in multiple sections of developing each new project, and considered a valuable member of each team.\n\nAs a versatile professional, I am capable of conceptualizing and supporting critical frameworks and formative web applications. My colleagues know me to be intrinsically motivated in areas of problem solving \u2013 my ability to analyse obstacles from a unique perspective allows me to creatively develop multiple pathways from which to tackle problems. I also excel in conducting research and gathering data for developing practical and original solutions, and am highly efficient in facilitating the implementation of these solutions. Troubleshooting is an inevitable part of software development, but approaching it with a positive attitude allows for final products to push the boundaries of their requirements, and achieve what originally seem unattainable.\n\nI am well versed in multiple areas that interconnect across the industry, with a strong focus on integrating web, mobile and desktop environments to ensure customer satisfaction. Working directly with clients has therefore also allowed me to develop a stronger understanding of user needs in order to best create an individually customized software solution. In order to be at the forefront of technological advances and software innovations, I believe it is vital to consistently push for a better product, rather than one that simply satisfies the basic requirements. This is the goal I continuously work towards, and it is what inspires the latest developments in the world of programming.\n\nKnown for a high-energy, self-organized and meticulous approach to projects, I have both team-building and leadership experience centred around streamlining processes for maximum efficiency. This is best achieved through a combination of quality, usability, security and scalability, and these are the core tenets that I expect myself to achieve for any project. I am a self-starter with a high level of motivation, and I am always eager to apply myself to projects in new ways. I also work well with colleagues and superiors, particularly due to my desire to improve myself \u2013 I am not hesitant to ask for suggestions and criticism, using them as a crucial opportunity to further perfect both my own processes as well as the end product.\n\nTechnical Summary\n\n1. .NET, C#, VB .NET, WinForm, ASP .NET, ASP.

He would even improvise and add his own creative twist to some of my concepts that ended up looking amazing. I would have never thought I could create page designs that would turn out so perfect but it was possible through Upwork and I hit a home-run with Raphael, I will forever be grateful for meeting and working together with him. Raphael is a true professional and was attentive to every detail and made every slight edit that I requested promptly and with no questions asked. I'm sad to end my contract with Raphael but I definitley plan on staying connected with him for projects I want to take on in the future.

My focus is on helping them design robust business models, develop clear and compelling value propositions, conduct market assessments that demonstrate the problem / needs, perform benchmarking of the relevant competitors, and develop prudent go-to-market approach. I work together with my clients in order to prepare them for the meetings with investors, partners and clients. \n\nI have been advising venture capital funds and corporations on investments, feasibility studies and acquisitions with top consulting companies like A.T.Kearney and KPMG. I managed projects with total value of more than 2 billion dollars, in multiple sectors and in more than 15 countries in Europe, Latin America and Noth America. Working at corporate level with CEOs, Directors and investors, I know \"what\" and \"how\" to present to potential investors and partners.  \n\nIn working with my clients, the guiding principles are professional integrity, honesty and effort to walk the extra mile. There are no ready to apply solutions for developing business plans or preparing for fundraising - every business, value proposition, business model, competitive situation and market trends are combined in a unique manner. We need a structured approach and readiness to break some \"common wisdoms\" in order to design our road to the success. I am ready to help my clients with all the knowledge and experience accumulated in more than 20 years working with exceptional clients and colleagues. My website for the Spanish speaking clients is suStartUp.com. Additionally I am leading a boutique focused on cross-border M&A - eeinetwork.com \n\nI have an MBA from IESE, ranked by Financial Times as #7 in the World, ahead of schools like MIT, Kellog, Berkeley, Chicago, etc. \n\nOn Upwork tests I am among the Top 10% for Venture Capital Consulting, Financial Analysis, Marketing Research and Management Skills.\n\nWith regard to the project execution, one of the key success factors is the fluent and open communication with my clients. I also understand that the time is one of the most precious resources an entrepreneur has, and we have to optimize its usage. My approach to project development is the following:\n\n1.\tAfter an initial conference call to get a feeling about the business, I will prepare and send a list of questions that will help us prepare the business plan or the pitch deck. \n\n2.\tWhile my client reads the questions and prepares the answers, I will review the existing documentation about the project (draft pitch deck, business plans, notes, etc.)\n\n3.\tWe will have a conference call of about 1:30 to 2:00 hours to go through the list of questions and get deeper into the value proposition, the target clients and the business model.\n\n4.\tI will prepare a first draft of a document and we will have a second conference call to go through it and better focus the sections that need changes, and will start adding some new information (market sizing, competitive benchmarking, etc.)\n\n5.\tBased on this second conference call and the study of the market and the competitors, I will produce a second draft. With this the main part of the analytical work will be done.\n\n6.\tThis will prepare us for the development of the financial model that will support our business plan / pitch deck. We have to know where we want to be in three or five years, and how we are going to get there in order to develop a model that will help us play with scenarios. The financial model introduces some discipline to the assumptions and the relations between the different variables, and helps you estimate the percentage of the capital you can give the investors in exchange for their money.   \n\n7.\tOnce we played with the model (scenarios) and probably adjusted some of the assumptions and approaches developed in the second draft of the document, we are ready to prepare the final version of our document and finalize the project. \n\nThis is a general approach to the project implementation. Depending on the project focus and level of preparation of my clients, we can take a different approach for some projects. \n", "education": {"institution": [{"ed_to": "01/1999", "ed_area": "", "ed_school": "IESE Business School", "ed_comment": "Ranked #7 by Financial Times, ahead of Business schools like MIT, Kellog, Berkeley, Chicago, etc.", "ed_from": "01/1997", "ed_degree": "Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.)"}, {"ed_to": "12/1992", "ed_area": "Corporate Finance", "ed_school": "Nottingham Trent University", "ed_comment": "", "ed_from": "01/1992", "ed_degree": ""}]}, "dev_portrait_50": "https://odesk-prod-portraits.s3.amazonaws.com/Users:tvelev:PortraitUrl_50?AWSAccessKeyId=1XVAX3FNQZAFC9GJCFR2&Expires=2147483647&Signature=v4i6jgdZCkdf5mMTmWSg3Qo%2BlZU%3D", "assignments": {"hr": {"job": [{"as_total_hours": "9.33", "as_rate": "$130.00", "as_financial_privacy": "0", "as_to": "Present", "as_from_full": "09/19/2017", "as_ciphertext_opening_recno": "~014316c31c3f27be8b", "as_total_hours_precise": "9.33333333", "as_opening_title": "Pitch Deck Engine", "as_job_type": "Hourly", "as_to_full": "Present", "as_agency_name": "", "as_total_charge": "0"}, {"as_total_hours": "0.50", "as_rate": "$130.00", "as_total_charge": "65", "as_to": "Present", "as_from_full": "09/17/2017", "as_ciphertext_opening_recno": "~015c26c27f70f7a528", "as_total_hours_precise": "0.5", "as_opening_title": "Business plan/ pitch deck etc.", "as_job_type": "Hourly", "as_to_full": "Present", "as_agency_name": "", "as_financial_privacy": "0"}, {"as_total_hours": "0.00", "as_rate": "$130.00", "as_to": "Present", "as_total_hours_precise": "0", "as_opening_title": "A-Listers Wanted as Mentors on Advisory Board for Ambitious Crypto Venture", "as_job_type": "Hourly", "as_to_full": "Present"}, {"as_to": "09/2017", "as_rate": "$130.00", "as_total_charge": "2253.33", "as_total_hours": "17", "as_total_hours_precise": "17.33333334", "as_opening_title": "Fundraising pitch deck specialist", "as_job_type": "Hourly", "as_to_full": "09/21/2017"}, {"as_total_hours": "6.67", "as_rate": "$130.00", "as_total_charge": "953.67", "as_to": "08/2017", "as_from_full": "07/24/2017", "as_ciphertext_opening_recno": "~01e9a5795c86321387", "feedback": {"comment": "Todor is a high level thinker and planner who quickly grasped my business concept and re-presented it as requested.
