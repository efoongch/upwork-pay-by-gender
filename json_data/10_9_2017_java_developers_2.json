I was, admittedly, not the best of managers on this project because some of the requirements were unclear, and some requirements changed two months into the project. At the same time, George's attention to detail on bugs was only middling, and he kept missing deadlines. As the project wore on, this problem got worse and worse until I was forced to end the contract without a few key elements completed, including, of all things, the user instructions. I am left with an excellent product with some major bugs that I will have to figure out how to fix myself without instructions (only the comments in the code). In conclusion, I would endorse George for projects as long as clear expectations are set on deadlines with financial penalties if these deadlines are not met.", "score": "3.80", "scores": {"score": [{"score": "5", "description": "competency and skills for the job, understanding of specifications/instructions", "label": "Skills"}, {"score": "5", "description": "quality of work deliverables", "label": "Quality"}, {"score": "3", "description": "online presence on a consistent schedule", "label": "Availability"}, {"score": "1", "description": "ability to complete tasks on time", "label": "Deadlines"}, {"score": "3", "description": "communication skills, frequent progress updates, responsiveness", "label": "Communication"}, {"score": "5", "description": "cooperation and flexibility, suggestions for improvement", "label": "Cooperation"}]}}, "as_to": "06/2013", "as_total_hours_precise": "152.00000004", "as_opening_title": "Excel pricing configurator re-write", "as_job_type": "Hourly", "as_to_full": "06/21/2013"}, {"as_to": "06/2017", "as_rate": "$20.00", "feedback": {"comment": "Of all the developers I have worked with on Upwork, George Vyshnia is by far the strongest, both in terms of skills and collaboration but also in terms of project management and proactive creativity.
