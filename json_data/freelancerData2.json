I know how to explain complicated topics so that they walk away from your blog feeling satisfied instead of perplexed. \n\nMany businessmen, lawyers, tech nerds, and other experts in their fields are awesome at their job - whether that means running a business, obscure litigation, staying up all night coding, or fly-fishing. \nBut often, those experts are not so great at explaining how their field works to other people. And that makes sense. After all, you\u2019re a businessman, not a writer. Your job is to run a company - and you're damn good at it. \n\nAttracting paying customers through your blog can be as simple as hitting the big green \u201cHire now\u201d button on the top right.
