Legal Aid Clinic in DFW
Contract Law Posted 1 day ago
I have an existing relatioship with CLS and prior experience working in Legal Aid. First task is to find attorneys in Dallas Fort Worth that might be interested in contributing some hours pro bono.  Because of CLS affiliation, those attorneys should visit https://www.christianlegalsociety.org/ and be familiar with their mission.  This would be an independent office but affiliated with CLS as part of their USA legal aid philanthropy. 

after we find interested lawyers, we can decide about where in DFW to set up a presence.
