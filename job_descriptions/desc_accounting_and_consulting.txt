Setup Xero payroll accounting software for OPT fulltime employee
I am in the process of hiring our first full time employee in Pennsylvania for our startup. I am using Xero payroll software. I am trying to do direct bank deposit. I want to make sure that the setup is correct. I have few question regarding the setup. He agreed to work as a contractor but realized his renewal will be difficult since his OPT is part of STEM.
