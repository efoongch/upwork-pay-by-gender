One Short Media Report
I need a translator who will translate the short media report from Chinese into English. You do not want to translate those advertisements or links on top/bottom/sides. Proof-reading is preferred before you send your translation to me.  Your pay is to be calculated 2 cents per translated English word. So you do not need to worry about how much I deposit now as I have no clue about the total number of the words right now as I am typing.  A quality of translation work will allow me to use only a small amount of time to review and edit your translation.Skills and Expertise
