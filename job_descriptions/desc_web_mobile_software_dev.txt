Website Dealer Locator
Web Development Posted 50 minutes ago

I am looking for a person to help me with a dealer locator for our website. We have two website platforms meshed together they are Volusion and Wordpress,I am looking to go to Drupal in the future so I want something that can easily be plugged into the Drupal platform.I will attach the style of Dealer Locator I want as a attachment it will show screen shots. One clarification is that if there is not dealer in the zip code they enter that our info will show up as the dealer.So the entire USA will always show someone as there contact for purchase. I am thinking of having the find a dealer option in the header of the website as well as on a dealer specific page and even on the shopping cart pages if possible. I will want to do a interview with you before hiring.
