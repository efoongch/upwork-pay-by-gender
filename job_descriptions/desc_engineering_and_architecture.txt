Put together off-the-shelf valves and controllers
We are looking to put together these two valves and figure a way to control them with a PC.

We need a presentation ready prototype, sort of enclosure that houses both valves and controllers and some way of connecting to these valves via a USB cable. Likely will have to design and 3D print an enclosure, then figure the best way to connect to PC: Arduino-BCD, straight RS-232 etc. 
We are located in Culver City, (greater Los Angeles) will strongly prefer to work with local people.
